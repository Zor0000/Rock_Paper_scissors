# Rock_Paper_scissors
This repository contains a C implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors". The game is played between two players,
each simultaneously forming one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: rock (a fist), paper (palm facing downward),
or scissors (two fingers extended). The rules are straightforward:
- Rock smashes scissors.
- Paper covers rock.
- Scissors cut paper.
